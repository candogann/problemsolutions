# What this is?

Well, i kinda need to train myself in more "conventional" problem solving, and also should deal with some of my bad habits. Most of the solutions will basically abuse dictionaries. I also will try to focus on a new language aside python for problem solving.

I kinda hope for solving a or two problem each day on leetcode. Maybe on HackerRank as well? I don't know.

Cheers.
